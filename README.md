## Description

### Proyect consideration

#### semantic-release plugins

When used with the `@semantic-release/git` or `@semantic-release/npm` plugins the `@semantic-release/changelog` plugin must be called before those plugins in order to update the changelog file so the `@semantic-release/git` and `@semantic-release/npm` plugins can include it in the release.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
